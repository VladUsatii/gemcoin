# Key Utility ðŸ”‘

Our key utility generates a random key, specific to every person in the world.

## Gemcoin Wallets: A Walkthrough

To get started, you simply run ```main.py```.

After running, type in a "salt" or a secure password. This **must** be large. Save this password and don't share it with anyone! This gives people access to your private key if put in the wrong hands.

After generating an address, the key utility will print both the private, the public, and the checksum.

Copy the private key into terminal after typing the following:

```bash
gemcoin-address [ key ]
```

After typing this, you can now make transactions to public addresses. These transactions will be added to the ledger and you can now participate in the gemcoin network.

**Next Steps** (if you haven't already)

- Run the network until the initial block download is complete
- Participate in the network
- Send transactions from the command line utility

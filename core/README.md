# Core

A Pythonic interface to the blockchain.

## How does Core work?

Core combines three types of functions into an omniscient handler:

```
- Transactions
  * A way to send them
  * A way to program contracts
    * On chain interactions
    * Off chain interactions (e.g. scheduled transactions)

- Mining blocks
  * A way to guess nonce
  * Verification of block (block integrity)
  * A mechanism for sending block proposals to peers
    * Peer verification of blocks

- Data Updates
  * Performs requests for headers and blocks
  * Performs verifications of header/blocks and dumps any wrong transactions
```

The omniscient handler is:

```
- Omniscient Network Handler
  * Asynchronous collection of mempool transactions, block mining, and header/block updating (based on node level)
  * Default operation mode (./peers/main.py)
```

## Running Omniscient Handler

This system works differently than Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. In Gemcoin's system, one single peer-to-peer network asynchronously connects to peers and requests data based on its current "need." A clock system refuses any malicious overflows of transaction/header broadcasts. A clock is useful for requesting blocks if a block update is assumed.

To run, use:

```
#tbd
```

## Sending a transaction ðŸ“§

To send a transaction, open up a new file. This is where you want to have stored your private key, public key, and address.

First, write out:

```python3
raw_tx = ConstructTransaction(...)
```

Then, make sure to construct a valid signature using the following function:

```python3
from sendShards import *

priv_key = "..." # must be in hex format
pub_key = "..." # must be in hex format

signed_tx = SignTransaction(raw_tx, priv_key)
```

To locally validate your transaction (like every other node will), run..

```python3
ConfirmTransactionValidity(signed_tx)

# if returns True : should be sent as a valid transaction (the signed_tx variable should be broadcast to peers)
# if returns False : should NOT be sent as a valid transaction and will be dumped by peers
```

That's all, folks.

New types of transactions are coming as well. Watch out for those!

NOTE: This is one of the most stress-inducing concepts I've ever written documentation on or programmed. I want everyone to know that with enough perseverance, anything can be programmed.. even if you don't have a high-school diploma.
